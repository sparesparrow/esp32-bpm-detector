Perform comprehensive code review combining multiple skills:

1. Use oms-cpp-style to check C++ coding standards compliance
2. Use dev-intelligence-orchestrator for static analysis
3. Use mcp-prompts `/analysis` for code quality insights
4. Check for:
   - Memory leaks and resource management
   - Performance bottlenecks
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - OMS style compliance
   - ESP32-specific best practices

Provide actionable recommendations with priority levels.
