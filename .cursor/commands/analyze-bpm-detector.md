Analyze the BPM detection algorithm and audio processing code for performance bottlenecks, memory usage, and optimization opportunities. Use the embedded-audio-analyzer skill to:

1. Profile the current FFT configuration and identify memory/CPU constraints
2. Analyze beat detection accuracy and suggest improvements
3. Review signal processing pipeline for optimization opportunities
4. Check for ESP32-specific optimizations (DMA, I2S, memory allocation)

Focus on the audio processing code in `src/` and provide specific recommendations for ESP32 memory constraints.
