Refactor the selected code to match OMS C++ coding standards. Use the oms-cpp-style skill to:

1. Apply OMS naming conventions (variables, functions, classes)
2. Use smart pointers (unique_ptr, shared_ptr) where appropriate
3. Ensure RAII compliance for resource management
4. Follow OMS code organization and formatting patterns
5. Apply OMS testing patterns if creating unit tests

Reference the OMS projects in `~/projects/oms/` for pattern examples. Check `.claude/skills/oms-cpp-style/references/` for documented conventions.
