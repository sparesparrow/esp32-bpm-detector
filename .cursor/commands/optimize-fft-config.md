Optimize the FFT configuration for ESP32 audio processing using the embedded-audio-analyzer skill.

1. Analyze current FFT configuration (sample rate, FFT size, windowing)
2. Profile performance (CPU usage, memory, latency)
3. Get optimization guidance from mcp-prompts for ESP32 constraints
4. Evaluate tradeoffs between resolution, latency, and memory
5. Test beat detection accuracy with optimized configuration

Use the embedded-audio-analyzer skill workflow:
- Phase 1: Performance Profiling
- Phase 2: Beat Detection Optimization
- Phase 3: Signal Processing Refinement
