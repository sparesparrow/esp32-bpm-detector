# MCP Prompts Slash Commands

This project uses the mcp-prompts MCP server which provides intelligent prompt templates accessible via slash commands. These commands are automatically available in Cursor's chat interface.

## Available Slash Commands

### Analysis & Insights Commands
These commands activate the **Analysis Assistant** prompt template:

- `/analysis` - Activate analysis assistant for code or project analysis
- `/insights` - Get insights about code, architecture, or project structure
- `/ai-assistant` - General AI assistant powered by analysis prompts
- `/analysis-assistant` - Full command name for analysis assistant

**Use Cases:**
- Analyzing code quality and patterns
- Getting insights on project structure
- Understanding codebase relationships
- Performance analysis
- Security analysis

**Example Usage:**
```
/analysis Analyze the BPM detection algorithm for performance bottlenecks
/insights What are the key architectural patterns in this ESP32 project?
```

### Architecture & Design Commands
These commands activate the **Architecture Design Assistant** prompt template:

- `/architecture` - Get architecture design guidance
- `/design` - Design patterns and system design assistance
- `/programming` - Programming best practices and patterns
- `/architecture-design-assistant` - Full command name for architecture assistant

**Use Cases:**
- System architecture design
- Design pattern recommendations
- Code organization and structure
- Component design
- API design

**Example Usage:**
```
/architecture Design a modular audio processing pipeline for ESP32
/design Suggest design patterns for the BPM detector state machine
```

### Build System & Automation Commands
These commands activate the **automate-cpython-orchestration** prompt template:

- `/cpython` - CPython-specific automation and orchestration
- `/conan` - Conan package management automation
- `/zero-copy` - Zero-copy optimization strategies
- `/automation` - General automation assistance
- `/orchestration` - Build and deployment orchestration
- `/ci-cd` - CI/CD pipeline configuration and optimization
- `/symlinks` - Symbolic link management and strategies
- `/build-system` - Build system configuration and optimization
- `/automate-cpython-orchestration` - Full command name

**Use Cases:**
- Conan package management workflows
- Build system optimization
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Zero-copy performance optimization
- Cross-platform build orchestration
- Symbolic link strategies for development

**Example Usage:**
```
/conan Optimize the Conan profile configuration for ESP32 builds
/ci-cd Set up a CI/CD pipeline for this embedded project
/build-system Improve the CMake build configuration
```

### Code Refactoring Commands
These commands activate the **Code Refactoring Assistant** prompt template:

- `/refactoring` - Code refactoring assistance
- `/optimization` - Code optimization guidance
- `/code-refactoring-assistant` - Full command name

**Use Cases:**
- Refactoring legacy code
- Performance optimization
- Code quality improvement
- Reducing technical debt
- Modernizing code patterns

**Example Usage:**
```
/refactoring Refactor the audio processing code to use modern C++ patterns
/optimization Optimize the FFT implementation for ESP32 memory constraints
```

## How to Use Slash Commands

### In Cursor Chat
1. Type `/` in the chat input to see available commands
2. Select a command or type the full command name
3. Add your query or context after the command
4. The command will apply the appropriate prompt template from mcp-prompts

### Command Format
```
/command [your query or context]
```

### Examples
```
/analysis What are the memory usage patterns in src/main.cpp?

/architecture Design a message passing system for ESP32 to Android communication

/conan How should I configure Conan profiles for multi-target deployment?

/refactoring Refactor bpm_detector.h to use smart pointers and RAII
```

## Integration with Project Skills

These slash commands work alongside the project's Claude skills:

- **dev-intelligence-orchestrator**: Use `/analysis` or `/optimization` before running static analysis
- **embedded-audio-analyzer**: Use `/optimization` for FFT and signal processing improvements
- **oms-cpp-style**: Use `/refactoring` to apply OMS patterns to code

## MCP Server Configuration

The mcp-prompts server is configured in `.claude/mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "prompts": {
      "command": "mcp-prompts",
      "args": ["--storage", "file", "--path", "/home/sparrow/projects/ai-mcp-monorepo/packages/mcp-prompts/data/prompts"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Command Categories

### General Purpose
- `/analysis`, `/insights`, `/ai-assistant` - General analysis and insights
- `/architecture`, `/design`, `/programming` - Design and architecture guidance

### Build & Automation
- `/conan`, `/build-system`, `/ci-cd` - Build and deployment automation
- `/automation`, `/orchestration` - General automation tasks

### Code Quality
- `/refactoring`, `/optimization` - Code improvement and optimization

### Specialized
- `/cpython`, `/zero-copy`, `/symlinks` - Specific technical domains

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Include context in your query after the slash command
2. **Combine Commands**: Use multiple commands in sequence for complex tasks
3. **Iterate**: Use commands iteratively to refine solutions
4. **Document Results**: Save useful prompt responses for future reference
5. **Leverage Templates**: The mcp-prompts server learns from successful interactions

## Troubleshooting

If slash commands don't appear:
1. Verify mcp-prompts server is running and configured in `.claude/mcp.json`
2. Check MCP server status in Cursor: `View: Open MCP Settings`
3. Restart Cursor if commands don't appear after configuration
4. Check mcp-prompts server logs for connection issues
